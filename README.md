## ✨ About This Project

Have you ever wondered how random events behave?  
How probability distributions form? Or how data reveals its hidden stories?

`probability-statistics-r-lib` is a passion project — a growing collection of **R scripts** crafted to **simulate**, **analyze**, and **visualize** key concepts in **probability and statistics**.  
From basic descriptive statistics to hypothesis testing and sampling distributions, this library brings statistical thinking to life through clean, reproducible, and engaging code.

> 💡 "Statistics is the art of learning from data. And code is how we explore that art."

---

## 📚 What You’ll Find

- ✅ Well-commented R scripts for fundamental statistics topics  
- ✅ Simulations of random variables and probability distributions  
- ✅ Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression examples  
- ✅ ggplot2-based visualizations and reproducible code structures  
- ✅ Realistic datasets for practice and exploration  

---

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

- Students learning statistics or R programming  
- Educators looking for demos and statistical simulations  
- Data enthusiasts exploring the world through numbers  
- Anyone curious about randomness, inference, or data science 🔢📈

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Statistics is more than formulas — it's about *understanding uncertainty*.  
By visualizing and simulating data, we:

- Build stronger intuition 👁️  
- Make abstract concepts concrete 🧱  
- Learn actively, not passively 💡
